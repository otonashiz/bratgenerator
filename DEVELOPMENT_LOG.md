# Brat Generator - Development Log

## 2025-06-24: v1.1 - UX & Visual Polish

Today's focus was on refining the core user experience and visual details based on user feedback. We successfully addressed all identified issues.

### ‚úÖ Progress & Achievements

1.  **Text Centering Fixed:**
    *   **Issue:** Text was not correctly centered, especially multi-line text.
    *   **Solution:** Corrected the vertical and horizontal alignment calculations within the `renderText` utility. Ensured `textAlign` and `textBaseline` properties are consistently applied.

2.  **Scribble Effect Reworked:**
    *   **Issue:** The "scribble" effect appeared as random lines across the canvas, not as a "crossing out" effect over the text.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Phase 1 (Initial Fix):** Re-engineered the scribble generator to create 4-10 main strokes that specifically cross the text area.
        *   **Phase 2 (Precision Fix):** Identified that the live preview (`Canvas.tsx`) wasn't using the new logic. The rendering pipeline was refactored to be more robust:
            1.  The `renderText` function now returns the precise bounding box of the rendered text.
            2.  This bounding box is passed to the `generateScribblePattern` function.
            3.  The result is that all scribble lines are now generated *perfectly* over the actual text, regardless of text length or content.

3.  **Scribble Aesthetics Refined:**
    *   **Analysis:** Investigated the source of "wavy" non-linear strokes, confirming they are an intended result of using Bezier curves to simulate a natural, hand-drawn feel.
    *   **Action:** Based on user feedback for a cleaner look, the secondary, shorter "texture" scribbles were disabled, leaving only the primary crossing-out lines.

4.  **Brand Color Corrected:**
    *   **Issue:** The project was using an incorrect shade of green (`#BEFF34`).
    *   **Action:** Updated the primary brand color to the user-specified **`#8BCF01`**. This change was applied globally across all relevant files, including `colors.ts`, `globals.css`, and all components using the color.

### üìù Next Steps

The core features of the generator are now stable and visually correct according to the latest feedback. The remaining tasks are focused on final cleanup and preparation for a potential handoff or deployment:

1.  **Final Code Review:**
    *   Address any minor warnings, such as the `useCallback` dependency warning in `useGenerator.ts`.
    *   Ensure code comments and documentation are up-to-date.
2.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** A final round of testing to confirm all features work as expected.
3.  **Prepare for Deployment:** Create a production build and prepare for deployment.
